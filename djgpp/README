This directory contains the Makefile and config.h needed to compile
libWilMidi library and wildmidi player for DOS using DJGPP.


To compile, you need DJGPP library and its associated compiler suite.
Both djgpp-v2.03 and v2.04 should work.  DJGPP is available from its
official site at <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/>
Cd in to the djgpp directory and run 'make', i.e.:

  cd djgpp
  make

.. which will generate libWildMidi.a and wildmidi.exe.


The library part (libWildMidi.a) is fully functional.  The player
part (wildmidi.exe) only outputs a wav file.  Run like:

  wildmidi -o output.wav mymidi.mid

An actual sound output functionality might be added later.
